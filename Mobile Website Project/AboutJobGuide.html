	<h4 class="text-center">About the H-Net Job Guide
	</h4>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px">
		The H-Net Job Guide began over twenty years ago as a service to professionals and institutions in the Humanities and Social Sciences and to support H-Net's broader mission of advancing communications and publishing in new media. H-Net's broad audience includes: graduate students, K-12 teachers, archivists, librarians, interested professionals, the educated general public and many others. Because of our diverse audience we are able to offer a wide range of academic and non-academic job announcements. With over 100,000 page views per week, the H-Net Job Guide is one of H-Net's most visible components.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px">
		The Job Guide is free to the job seeker but we do collect a fee of $225 (US dollars) from the job poster. This fee helps us to continue to maintain and improve the H-Net Job Guide. However, as H-Net considers the Job Guide a service to the academic community we do grant fee waivers (see the Job Guide Policy page for more information) on a case-by-case basis to those institutions and NPOs genuinely unable to make payment.
	</p>
	<p>
		For more information about H-Net please see the About H-Net page.

		For information on the Job Guide's privacy and posting policies, see the Job Guide Policy page.
