		<b>Q:</b> What is the H-Net Job Guide?<br>
		<b>A:</b> The Job Guide posts academic position announcements in the Humanities and Social Sciences serving a broad audience of administrators, faculty members, archivists, librarians, and other professionals in the humanities and social sciences. The Job Guide is fully sortable and searchable, and is available via email and the web at no cost to the job seeker. For further information see the About Job Guide page.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Q:</b> What is the fee for posting a job post?<br>
		<b>A:</b> We charge a base rate of $225 (US dollars) per post. If you would like to include a logo there is an additional $40 (US dollars) charge. If you would like to feature your post on the Job Guide there is an additional $90 charge. Featured job postings will also be shared with subscribers on our social media outlets (Twitter and Facebook).
	</p>

	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Q:</b> Will my job be posted on the network(s) that cover its field?<br>
		<b>A:</b> Not automatically. All new posts from the previous week are sent to the editors of our networks as a digest on Monday mornings. Editors select job posts from that digest to include on their respective networks. Editors, not the Job Guide staff, decide what to publish on their networks. Once a job post has been published on the Job Guide, you are free to write to network editors to request posting there.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Q:</b> Why was my credit card declined?<br>
		<b>A:</b> We may not be able to tell you. To protect cardholder privacy, card issuers do not provide vendors with complete information about why a card was declined. Generally, you will have to contact your card company to get specific information about a declined transaction.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Q:</b> Is it possible to waive the fee?<br>
		<b>A:</b> In very limited cases, yes. For more information on our fee waiver policy see the Job Posting Policy page.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Q:</b> What is the submission deadline for a job post to be published?<br>
		<b>A:</b> As the H-Net Job Guide is an online publication there is no submission deadline. Once submitted your job post should appear online within 72 business hours. You may also set a posting date for the post if you would like us to hold the post until a specific day.
